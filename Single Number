# Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
# Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?


-----------------------
Ver 1:  Use a set
Since all but 1 number appears twice, sum(unique nums)*2 - sum(nums) = single num
O(n) time. O(n) space for using set.
-----------------------
class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return(sum(set(nums)) * 2 - sum(nums))
        

-----------------------
Ver 2:  Use ^ Binary XOR
We know that x ^ x = 0, and (x^y) ^ (x^y) = 0, and so on.
Because each bit can only be 0 or 1, the order of the numbers do not matter.
If we take the xor of all numbers, the result must be the single number.
O(n) time. O(1) space.

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        result = nums[0]
        for num in nums[1:]:
            result ^= num
        return result
