"""
Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters. 
Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) 
so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.
Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:
It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
Output: "lee(t(c)o)de"
Explanation: "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.
Example 2:
Input: s = "a)b(c)d"
Output: "ab(c)d"
Example 3:
Input: s = "))(("
Output: ""
Explanation: An empty string is also valid.
Example 4:
Input: s = "(a(b(c)d)"
Output: "a(b(c)d)"
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is one of  '(' , ')' and lowercase English letters.
