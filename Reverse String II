# Given a string and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. 
# If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. 
# If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, reverse the first k characters and leave the other untouched.
# Example: Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2. Output: "bacdfeg"
