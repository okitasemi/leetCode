# Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence 
# while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.
# Example 1: 
# Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
# Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

# In 1, a new reference is created for word and wordList is not affected
# In 2, wordList[i] is affected
